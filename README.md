# Bank-Account
In this project, we'll create a Python class that can be used to create and manipulate a personal bank account. 
The bank account class you'll create should have methods for each of the following: 
1. Accepting deposits 
2. Allowing withdrawals 
3. Showing the balance 
4. Showing the details of the account
